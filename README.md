Image Processing Tool

Description

This application is designed to resize, invert, and convert images to grayscale using C++ with the Qt5 framework. It provides a user-friendly interface for manipulating images efficiently. Whether you're resizing images for web use, inverting colors for artistic effects, or converting to grayscale for monochrome display, this tool simplifies the process with intuitive controls and real-time previews.
Features

    Image Resizing: Change the dimensions of images while maintaining aspect ratio.
    Color Inversion: Invert colors to create negative effects or artistic interpretations.
    Grayscale Conversion: Convert images to grayscale for monochrome display or printing.
    Real-Time Previews: Preview changes instantly to adjust settings according to visual feedback.
    User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive controls and options for easy manipulation of images.

Technologies Used

    C++: Core programming language for efficient image processing algorithms.
    Qt5: Framework for developing cross-platform graphical user interfaces.
    ImageMagick (optional): Utilizes ImageMagick library for advanced image processing functionalities.
    File Handling: Supports various image file formats for input and output operations.

Installation

    Prerequisites:
        C++ compiler with C++11 support (e.g., GCC, Clang)
        Qt5 development libraries and tools installed

    Setup:
        Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/maiaresizer/repository.git

        Ensure any additional dependencies like ImageMagick are properly configured if used.

    Usage:
        Launch the application after successful build.
        Open an image file using the file menu or drag-and-drop functionality.
        Choose an operation (resize, invert, grayscale) from the toolbar or menu.
        Adjust parameters as needed and preview changes in real-time.
        Save the modified image using the appropriate file format.
